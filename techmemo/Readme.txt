Warren,
     
Apropos of Arnold's revival of Brenda Baker's struct, here's a scan of
her original TM about it. 46 years on, I am not concerned about
releasing proprietary information that is little different from her
1977 JACM paper. If there's any guilt, the mailing label on the cover
sheet reveals that I am the culprit.
