# struct --- Convert Fortran into Ratfor

This is Brenda Baker's `struct` program.  It converts plain old Fortran
into Rational Fortran (ratfor).  The code here is taken from the TUHS
archives, starting with the V7 version, and progressing through V8 and
V10.  Overall, the code changed very little from the initial V7 version.
The branches `v7-code`, `v8-code` and `v10-code` have the respective
versions.

This program has always fascinated me. I have always thought that
it was extremely cool.  Besides preserving the code in one place,
I would like to (try to) bring the code into the modern era,
in terms of C language usage and code formatting. We'll see if I
succeed.
